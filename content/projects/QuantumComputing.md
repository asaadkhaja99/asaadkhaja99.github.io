## Abstract
Quantum computing has been gaining popularity over the past few years because of its potential to outperform classical computers. Despite significant theoretical progress over past decades, physical implementations are still unable to implement the algorithms theorized to bring about blockbuster speedups over classical computers. The field is currently said to be in the noisy intermediate quantum (NISQ) era - where quantum computers are noisy and cannot be scaled up significantly. While work carries on towards moving the field into the fault-tolerant era by overcoming these challenges, there is scepticism about the utility of quantum computers. In this review, we provide an overview of quantum computing before discussing why the NISQ era persists, and what the most promising applications of NISQ quantum computers are.

As part of a job application, I also wrote a generally accessible version of this review. If you're interested you can read it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w0R6iLHgzXo_aT3HdsJXlYokQ7putRQM/view?usp=sharing).
