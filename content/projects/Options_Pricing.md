## Description
As part of the Cambridge LLM X Law Hackathon, I was part of a team of 5 other lawyers that developed a ChatBot capable of providing legal assistance to users about employment law in the Philippines using ChatGPT's GPT Builder tool. This allowed us to use our curated data, along with few-shot prompting, and prompt engineering to develop a chatbot that can ask legally relevant
follow-up questions to the user before suggesting potential legal claims the user has grounds for. 

The output of this ChatBot does not consitute as legal advice, but it can allow users to get a surface level understanding of the parts of the law that relate to them. Plans to expand the utility of these chatbot are currently in the works.
