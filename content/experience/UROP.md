### Description
- Refined the departmentâ€™s experimental physics teaching resources, conceptualizing 2 new projects and implementing
improvements in 3 existing projects
- Developed 2 new Python demonstrations and re-factored 2 existing demonstrations, doubling the extent of current physics
demonstrations, to effectively explain and demonstrate concepts such as Fast Fourier Transforms and Diffraction
- Conducted thorough data analysis of 3 existing experiments to identify over 4 previously undocumented sources of error
and devised modifications to fix these errors
- Used Pandas to automate the results processing phase of a experimental demonstration reducing processing time by 50%
- Developed a GUI application using Tkinter to allow automatic curve fitting of a [hysteris loop](https://www.nde-ed.org/Physics/Magnetism/HysteresisLoop.xhtml)

<!-- - Developed a multi-stage LLM pipeline using Llama3 to extract key information from X-Ray report images, leading to the creation of a new product in our suite.
- Architected and developed a cloud-native version of the product on Kubernetes and packaged it as a Helm chart for ease of deployment, distribution and versioning. 
- Enhanced operational efficiency by implementing GitOps at scale using ArgoCD, enabling centralized management of multiple K8s clusters, cutting down the release and software update timings by a magnitude.
- Established robust Kubernetes cluster monitoring and log aggregation through Grafana Agent and Grafana Cloud, allowing remote observability into customer installations.
- Built CI pipelines on GitHub Actions to automate building and testing of container images upon update to the product code.
- Automated end-to-end testing using PyTest, effectively saving over 4 hours of manual testing time per sprint.
- Strategically optimized the product's infrastructure on AWS, reducing the cloud cost by over 50%.
- Actively engaged with potential customers as the lead developer, providing technical guidance and support to drive customer success.
- Revamped the entire product codebase, improving reliability and readability while fixing numerous production bugs to ensure the smooth operation of the product on customer sites. -->
