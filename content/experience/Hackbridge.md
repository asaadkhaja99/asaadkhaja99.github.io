- Implemented Google Maps APIs with Python to generate optimal meeting points for drivers and passengers obtaining an approximately 2x speedup over the existing manual matching process 
- Formulated different methodologies for matching passengers and drivers to minimise the cost of making API requests, reducing the number of API calls by about 50\%
