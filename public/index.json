[{"content":"Description Developed a multi-stage LLM pipeline using Llama3 to extract key information from X-Ray report images, leading to the creation of a new product in our suite. Architected and developed a cloud-native version of the product on Kubernetes and packaged it as a Helm chart for ease of deployment, distribution and versioning. Enhanced operational efficiency by implementing GitOps at scale using ArgoCD, enabling centralized management of multiple K8s clusters, cutting down the release and software update timings by a magnitude. Established robust Kubernetes cluster monitoring and log aggregation through Grafana Agent and Grafana Cloud, allowing remote observability into customer installations. Built CI pipelines on GitHub Actions to automate building and testing of container images upon update to the product code. Automated end-to-end testing using PyTest, effectively saving over 4 hours of manual testing time per sprint. Strategically optimized the product\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure on AWS, reducing the cloud cost by over 50%. Actively engaged with potential customers as the lead developer, providing technical guidance and support to drive customer success. Revamped the entire product codebase, improving reliability and readability while fixing numerous production bugs to ensure the smooth operation of the product on customer sites.
